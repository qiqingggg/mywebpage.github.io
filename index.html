<p style="font-family:cambria;font-size:120%">
The Southern Ridges is a 10km stretch of green, open spaces that connect <b>Mount Faber Park, Telok Blangah Hill Park, HortPark, Kent Ridge Park and Labrador Nature Reserve.</b>

	<br>

In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) launched an Identity Plan that aimed to preserve and enhance the unique qualities of selected areas in Singapore.Southern Ridges was one of them. URA’s plan was to improve access to and connectivity within this 9 km chain of hills. One of the key ideas proposed was building a series of pedestrian linkages to connect Mount Faber, Telok Blangah Hill and Kent Ridge, including two bridges over Henderson Road and Alexandra Road. The Southern Ridges was opened to the public in 2008.

<b>Marang Trail:</b> Mount Faber Park<br><br>
The loud chirping of cicadas breaks the silence of the forest as you step off the 	escalator exiting HarbourFront MRT Station and enter the Marang Trail. If you are 	lucky, you might spot the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo (Dicrurus paradiseus), 		Blacknaped Oriole (Oriolus chinensis) and other birds amid the lush greenery.

<b>Henderson Waves:</b> Telok Blangah Hill Park<br><br>
At the start of Henderson Waves (Mount Faber Plaza) stands a nutmeg tree – a symbol of this area’s past when it was a nutmeg plantation. Walk a little further and you will see the distinctive wave-like structure of the 274m-long pedestrian bridge that matches its name perfectly.<br>
This charming, wood-panelled bridge was built to improve connectivity between nature areas. Between 7pm to 7am daily, the bridge takes on a different look, with the wave-form lit up by attractive LED lights.<br>
<p style="font-family:cambria;font-size:100%;color:DarkGreen;"><b>Highlight!</b> Good spot for viewing migratory birds of prey!</p>
Birdwatchers visiting between September and April get to spot various birds, such as Brahminy Kite (Haliastur indus), raptors and other winter
visitors, from atop the bridge.

<b>Canopy Walk:</b> Kent Ridge Park<br><br>
Canopy Walk is yet another trail on the Southern Ridges that offers trekkers the experience of walking through a secondary forest at eye-level with the forest canopy. It takes about 10 minutes to explore this 280m-long boardwalk that links Kent Ridge Park
to the museum “Reflections at Bukit Chandu”.<br>
Listen out for the sounds of birds and insects interrupting the serenity of the park. Sunbirds, doves, squirrels, lizards and the White-crested Laughingthrush (Garrulax leucolophus) are part of the rich biodiversity thriving here.<br>
